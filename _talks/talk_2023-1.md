What “Scrape ‘Talk’ Locations” Means

That message isn’t from Git or Jekyll directly — it’s coming from a GitHub Actions workflow (a .yml file under .github/workflows/).

In your case:
It sounds like your repo (likely based on AcademicPages or Minimal Mistakes academic template) includes a prebuilt automation called something like:

.github/workflows/scrape-talks.yml


This workflow automatically scrapes your talks (conference presentations) from your GitHub repository or a Google Sheet to build or update the “Talks” page.

So:

“Scrape ‘Talk’ Locations” = step name inside that Action.

The failure = GitHub Action ran but hit an error (often missing credentials, tokens, or wrong file paths).

⚙️ Why It’s Failing

Common reasons:

The workflow expects a Google API key or file that isn’t configured.

You don’t have a _talks/ folder or metadata files.

You forked the repo and it still points to someone else’s data source.

GitHub Pages build tries to execute Actions that aren’t relevant to your setup.
