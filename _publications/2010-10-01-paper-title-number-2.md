l-DOPA plays a critical role as a precursor to dopamine and is a standard treatment for Parkinson's disease. Recent research has highlighted the potential therapeutic advantages of deuterated l-DOPA analogs having a longer biological half-life. For their spectroscopic characterization, the in-detail characterization of l-DOPA itself is necessary. This article presents a thorough examination of the vibrational spectra of l-DOPA, with a particular emphasis on chirally sensitive VOA techniques. We successfully obtained high-quality Raman and ROA spectra of l-DOPA in its cationic form, under low pH conditions, and at a high concentration of 100 mg/ml. These spectra cover a broad spectral range, allowing for precise comparisons with theoretical simulations. We also obtained IR and VCD spectra, but they faced limitations due to the narrow accessible spectral region. Exploration of l-DOPA's conformational landscape revealed its intrinsic flexibility, with multiple coexisting conformations. To characterize these conformations, we employed two methods: one involved potential energy surface scans with implicit solvation, and the other utilized molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvation. Comparing ROA spectra from different conformer groups and applying spectral decomposition proved crucial in determining the correct conformer ratios. The use of explicit solvation significantly improved the quality of the final simulated spectral profiles. The accurate determination of conformer ratios, rather than solely relying on the number of averaged spectra, played a crucial role in simulation accuracy. In conclusion, our study offers valuable insights into the structure and conformational behavior of l-DOPA and represents a valuable resource for subsequent spectroscopic studies of its deuterated analogs.
